This repository contains a customer complaint chatbot developed using Python and TensorFlow. The chatbot leverages machine learning techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to understand and respond to customer complaints effectively. Additionally, SQL Workbench was used to interact with the database, and regular expressions were employed for data preprocessing.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLP techniques to process and understand customer complaints.
LSTM Model: Implements an LSTM model to handle sequential data and provide accurate responses.
Database Interaction: Uses SQL Workbench to store and retrieve complaint data.
Data Preprocessing: Applies regular expressions for cleaning and preprocessing text data.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for developing the chatbot.
TensorFlow: A machine learning framework used to build and train the LSTM model.
SQL Workbench: A tool used to interact with the database for storing and retrieving data.
Regular Expressions: Used for text preprocessing to clean and standardize the input data
